🚀 Prompt for Bolt.new
Project Name: Evently
Goal: Create a modern, mobile- and web-responsive event hosting and attending platform.

📱 Core Features to Start With (MVP)
User Types:

Attendee: Can view, accept/decline event cards, get notified, and manage event calendars.

Host: Can create events, invite users, and generate shareable links depending on event type.

🗂 Event Types (Cards)
Private Event

Only users explicitly invited by the host can access the event

No shareable link; attendees cannot invite others

Invite-Only Event

Users invited by the host receive a shareable link

Anyone who receives the link can access the event only if they meet the host’s predefined requirements (e.g., verified account, friend of attendee, location-based, etc.)

Public Event

Open to all users

Shareable public link allows anyone to join or RSVP, even without an account

✅ Attendee Flow
Browse, accept, or decline event cards (Private, Invite-Only, Public)

Add accepted events to the in-app calendar

Optionally sync accepted events with:

Google Calendar

Apple Calendar

Outlook

Receive notifications for:

Upcoming events they've accepted

Events they may be interested in (based on preferences)

Nearby events if location services are on (general or precise)

🧑‍💻 Host Flow
Create and manage events with:

Title, time, location, description, type (Private, Invite-Only, Public)

Invite attendees directly

Manage eligibility requirements for Invite-Only events

📲 Future Plans
We plan to develop and release a mobile app equivalent for this platform, available on both the App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android). The mobile app will provide a seamless native experience, integrated with the features built on the web.

🔁 Development Style: Agile
We are following the Agile methodology. This means:

Build a modular, scalable foundation

All features, animations, AI tools, and design enhancements should be easily extendable

Future updates must not break existing functionality

🧱 Summary
Build Evently as a mobile-first, fully responsive event platform where:

Hosts create Private, Invite-Only, or Public events

Attendees interact with personalized event cards

Premium users unlock AI tools, smart features, and exclusive content

The system is built for Agile-based iteration, with future native apps on the roadmap
